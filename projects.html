    <h2>Week 1</h2>
      <ul>
        <li class="projects">Monday (Day 1)</li>
          <ol class=week1>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/hello-world">Hello World</a></li>
              <p>This was my first html project and first repository. This was used to test basic git, and html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/goodbye">Goodbye</a></li>
              <p>This was another very basic html page Kat and I created to test out and learn unordered lists in html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Cookie-Recipe">Cookie Recipe/a></li>
              <p>We created this site in html to practice lists and headers.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Sparrow-the-cat">Sparrow the cat</a></li>
              <p>Another basic html site Kat and I made for her cat to try out css, second pages, and styling.</p>
          </ol>
        <li class="projects">Tuesday (Day 2)</li>
          <ol class="week1">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/branching-test">Branching Test </a></li>
              <p>This was just a test site and repo Nick and I made to test a few things and get a better understanding of branching in html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Private-Island">Private Island</a></li>
              <p>We made this site to practice branching in html. We made a few changes and eventually merged the branch we liked back into our gh-pages folder. </p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/my-favorite-places-with-nick">My Favorite Places</a></li>
              <p>This was another basic site showing our favotire things. We have a few other pages linked and used html and css.</p>
          </ol>
        <li class="projects">Wednesday (Day 3)</li>
          <ol class=week1>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/shelter">Shelter </a></li>
              <p>This project was our big project for Wednesday. We used div's, id's a sidebar, and made this animal shelter site reponsive. This was built using css and html. </p>
              <p><span class="special">This is my favorite project we have worked on so far</Span></p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Interior-Design">Interior Design</a></li>
              <p>We used this site to experiment with columns. We used HTML and CSS.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Blogging-site">Blogging Site</a></li>
              <p>We used basic html and css here to try out div's.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Resume">Resume</a></li>
              <p>Here is a sample resume I created to further explore div's and classes using basic html and css.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/band-site">Band Site</a></li>
              <p>We created this site for four of <em>The Beatles'</em>albums. We worked on adding images and styling in css and used html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/boring-lecture">Boring Lecture </a></li>
              <p>Another basic site Aubrey and I created to test out div's with images while referencing our style sheet in css. We also used html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/cupcake-shop">Cupcake Shop</a></li>
              <p>This site was very similar to "Boring Lecture." It was created to test out div's with images while referencing our style sheet in css. We also used html.</p>
          </ol>
        <li class="projects">Thursday (Day 4)</li>
          <ol class="week1">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Week-in-review"> Week in review</a></li>
              <p>This site showed everything we have learned/covered during the first week. We started using columns and rows to display the daily activites. We also started using bootstrap along with css and html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Vacation"> Vacation</a></li>
              <p>This site was really helpful because we started playing around with bootstrap along with css and html.</p>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/jamesmilanhiggins/Wikipedia"> Wikipedia Clone</a></li>
              <p>This site was supposed to replicate <em><a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/" >Wikipedia's Homepage</a></em> but we were on a bit of a time crunch, so we were unable to finalize this one. We used bootstrap, css and html.</p>
          </ol>
      </ul>
