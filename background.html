          I graduated from the University of Oregon in 2013 with a Bachelors of Science in Business. I also had a minor in Economics. Within the business school, I concentrated in Finance and Sports Business. After I graduated, I started a job doing accounting for a company called Dealer Spike, located just outside of Portland.

        <p class="phome">
          For amlost three years I worked at a local tech company called <em><a href="http://www.dealerspike.com/"> Dealer Spike.</a></em> This company made websites for powersport dealerships. I really enjoyed working for Dealer Spike, but I was not convinced I wanted to go down the accounting path. I had contact with Dealer Spike's developers and gradually became more interested in coding.

          My cousin had a friend that was doing the Epicodus program so he put me in contact with him. Immediately after my talk with his friend, I knew I wanted to apply for Epicodus. I applied and I was accepted, now here I am studying and writing code.
